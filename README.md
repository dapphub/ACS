# DappHub Applied Computer Science Working Group

## Members:

* Jack Ek
* Denis Erfurt
* Rain Break
* Mikael Brockman

## Purpose:

To apply computer science research towards the development of useful decentralized applications.

## Goals:

Specify real dapps at a high level and create proofs of their correctness

Make a decision about what smart contract platforms deserve our focus

Make applied computer science more accessible to non-experts

Figure out the bridge between blockchain and the semantic web

## Strategy:

Formally prove Maker’s correctness

Figure out the most valuable programming paradigm for smart contracts

Investigate and report on the landscape of blockchain architectures, both existing and emerging

Investigate the feasibility of a Linear-logic blockchain

Create human-readable specs and proofs

Gain expertise on existing technology related to the semantic web

## Tactics:

* LL Maker research (denis, rain)
  * Write tooling to do proof search
  * Implementation of the EVM in LL (research Ethereum client)
  * Create proofs about raw-EVM programs in LL
* PL investigation (jack)
  * Quantitative survey paper on paradigms and features
    * Dependently-typed lambda calculus (Idris)
    * Session types for process calculi
    * Semantic web languages
    * LL (Ceptre, Celf, …)
    * Hume
    * Pony
    * Michelson (Tezos)
    * Rholang (RChain)
    * whatever Semantic Web sorcery Tauchain is using
  * Deep dive follow up paper(s) on promising candidates
* Develop Symbex (mikael)
